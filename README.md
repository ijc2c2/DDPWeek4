Description (As I wasn't sure where to put the description. My apologies.)

This app uses the USArrests dataset in R. The app displays a basic plot of Murder Rate per 100,000 vs Assault Rate per 100,000. The user is able to see the trendline on the graph, but can toggle the line on or off. Additionally, the user can use the slider to calculate a specific Murder Rate estimate given a value on the slider for the Assault Rate.

Thanks for taking the time to look at this.
